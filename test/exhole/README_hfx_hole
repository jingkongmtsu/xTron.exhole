The spherically averaged exact exchange hole (or HF exchange hole) is 
often the target of approximate exchange hole models. It is a 1-d 
function per a reference point r, say h(x,r). An interesting derived 
object is the averaged spherical hole function over the whole molecule, 
i.e. H(x) = int(h(x,r), r=whole space). XTron can calculate h(x,r) and H(x).

A typical calculation includes two jobs. The first does a HF 
(or another DFT) calculation to get the orbitals. The second job computes 
the hole only. Here are the relevant input parameters for the second job:

%parameters
xcints.xcoper true
xcints.xcprop hfxhole
xcints.nsvalues 2     #number of x points. Points generated with dft radial point scheme.
xcints.1point 0.1     #1 r point. Used if grid_points=(1,1). The coord is (0.1, 0, 0)
xcints.1atom 0        #Use the grid points of atom 0 only.
xcints.holefile t.sv  #filename for output.
XCInts.XCHoleAvg.dumpBatchHoles true 
%end

%xcints
grid_points  3 1   #dft grid (number of radial points, number of angular points)
%end

In the code, the reference points are stored as grid points. Here are the 
lines of relevant code:
xcints.1point  Line 538 atomgrids.cpp
xcints.1atom  Line 42 molegrids.cpp

Output:
t.sv: h(x,r)
One block for each r.
In each block:
Line 1:  r coordinates.
Line 2: Comment 
Line 3: values of Rho, GAA, TA, LA
Line 4 to Line nsvalues+3:  x, h(x,r) 

t.sv.Avg:
Each line: x, H(x)
